== About The Funbox Base Theme ==

The Funbox Base Theme is a collection of basic theme files and functions designed to make some rather complex child themes.

This theme is for theme development fun. There are no options stored in the database or WordPress options panels to tinker with. I leave that functionality for you to make by either hacking these files or by creating a child theme. The goal is to expose as much WordPress theme functionality as possible to create complex child themes and intertwined themes (maybe someday I'll explain the scary intertwined comment).
